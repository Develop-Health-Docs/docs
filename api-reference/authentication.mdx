To access the Develop Health API, you need to authenticate your requests using an API token. The token should be included in the header of each request, as shown below:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Token <org_token>'
```

## API Tokens

API tokens are unique identifiers that grant you access to the Develop Health API. They enable secure communication between your application and our servers. An API key will be provided to you by your Develop Health account manager.
