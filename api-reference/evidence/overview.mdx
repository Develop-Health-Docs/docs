Now we've just got to work out which pieces of evidence you need to send us. **We'll help you with this!** With a quick 20 minute call we can make sure you're sending exactly what you need to. If you haven't chatted with us yet please [get in touch](mailto:support@develophealth.io) and we will walk you through the entire process.

## What we need

### Required Evidence

At the very least we need the prescription information and some clinical records backing up why the medication was prescribed. This can be in the form of a visit note, a questionnaire, or any other clinical record that you think is relevant.

### Optional Evidence (optional but highly recommended if you have them)

If you have any of the following pieces of evidence we highly recommend sending them over as well. This will help us to provide more accurate answers and improve the chance of the prior authorization being approved.

- Medication history
- Other visit notes
- Problems list
- Discontinued medications

## How to send it

You'll use the [POST /evidence](/api-reference/evidence/post-evidence) endpoint to send us your evidence. You'll need to send us a JSON object with the following properties:

<Accordion title="Evidence Request Body">
  <ParamField body="id" type="string" required>
    Your internal ID for this evidence. For example you could use the ID of the
    visit note in your database. Note that this ID in combination with the
    evidence type and patient_id must be unique.
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="patient_id" type="string" required>
    The patient ID. This should match with the ID of a previously created
    patient
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="type" type="string" required>
    Available options: Visit Note, Prescription, Questionnaire, Medication
    History, Other
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="date_created" type="string" required>
    The date when the record was created
  </ParamField>
  <ParamField body="content" type="object" required>
    The content object changes depending on the type property
  </ParamField>
</Accordion>

## Evidence Types

The `type` property of the evidence object determines what the `content` object will look like. The following sections will describe the `content` object for each type of evidence.

Type can be one of the following:

- Visit Note
- Prescription
- Questionnaire
- Medication History
- Other

Each content object also has an `other` key. You can use this nested object to include any other key value pairs that didn't fit into the predefined categories. This can be useful for adding other information that you think is useful that we haven't yet added to the top level fields. Our AI uses large language models and is able to handle a wide range of unstructuted data. So, we encourage you to send us as much relevant information as you can and we'll see if we can use it!

### Visit Note

We'll need the visit note that contains the doctors notes on why the patient is being given the prescribed medication. Normally this is the most recent note, but older notes can also provide important context.

<Accordion title="Example Visit Note">
```json
{
  "id": "23423jksjdf",
  "patient_id": "patient_324kljSDF3jd",
  "type": "Visit Note",
  "date_created": "2022-07-16T19:20:00Z",
  "content": {
    "text": "Patient Jane Doe visited the clinic today for a routine checkup. Her diabetes is not adequately controlled with her current medication. Ozempic has been prescribed to help improve blood sugar management. She reports no significant changes or concerns. Follow-up appointment scheduled in 3 months."
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

### Prescription

We'll need the prescription that contains the details of the medication that was prescribed to the patient. This should include the name of the medication, the dosage, and the frequency.

<Accordion title="Example Prescription">
```json
{
  "id": "8234jkfd34",
  "patient_id": "patient_324kljSDF3jd",
  "type": "Prescription",
  "date_created": "2022-07-16T19:20:00Z",
  "content": {
    "drug_name": "Ozempic",
    "quantity": "4 pens",
    "days_supply": 30,
    "strength": "0.5mg",
    "directions": "Inject 0.5mg once a week",
    "notes": "Store in refrigerator",
    "other": {}
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

### Questionnaire

Any questionnaires that the patient has answered with relevant information in are worth sending over

<Accordion title="Example Questionnaire">
```json
{
  "id": "sdf12341das",
  "patient_id": "patient_324kljSDF3jd",
  "type": "Questionnaire",
  "date_created": "2022-07-16T19:20:00Z",
  "content": [
    {
      "id": "Q56789",
      "question": "Are you currently taking any other medications for diabetes?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "choices": ["Yes", "No"],
      "other": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "Q98765",
      "question": "Have you experienced any side effects from your current diabetes medication?",
      "answer": "No",
      "choices": ["Yes", "No"],
      "other": {}
    }
  ]
}
```
</Accordion>

### Medication History

The patients medication history helps us demonstrate that the patient has tried other medications and that they have not been effective.

<Accordion title="Example Medication History">
```json
{
  "id": "6123ae12ddw32",
  "patient_id": "patient_324kljSDF3jd",
  "type": "Medication History",
  "date_created": "2022-07-16T19:20:00Z",
  "content": [
    {
      "id": "M67890",
      "drug_name": "Metformin",
      "dosage": "1000mg daily",
      "start_date": "2019-01-01",
      "end_date": "2020-01-01",
      "other": {}
    }
  ]
}
```
</Accordion>

### Other

If the content you want to send doesn't fit into any of the predefined categories you can use the 'other' content type.

<Accordion title="Example Other Content">
```json
{
  "id": "2341",
  "patient_id": "patient_324kljSDF3jd",
  "type": "Other",
  "date_created": "2022-07-16T19:20:00Z",
  "content": {
    "title": "Lab Results",
    "other": {}
  }
}
```
</Accordion>
